# Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This repository showcases my hands-on data cleaning project, which was guided by Alex the Analyst. The project's primary goal was to clean and organize disorderly Nashville housing data using SQL. This README provides a brief overview of the project's objectives, challenges, and outcomes.

## Project Details
- Guided By: Alex the Analyst
- Tools Used: SQL

## Tasks Accomplished
- Transformed date formats for consistency.
- Addressed missing data by filling in addresses.
- Split address components into separate parts, resulting in a more useful form of data.
- Converted 'Y' and 'N' values to 'Yes' and 'No' for uniformity.
- Managed and removed duplicate entries.
- Streamlined the dataset by eliminating unnecessary columns.

## Outcomes
Completing this project not only improved my proficiency in using SQL for data cleaning but also taught me valuable techniques for handling real-world data challenges.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Alex the Analyst for guiding me through this project and providing valuable insights.

Happy coding!
